COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Overview

This project involves the analysis of a COVID-19 dataset to uncover insights and visualize key trends. Using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, this project demonstrates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact across different regions.

Key Features

Data Cleaning: Preprocessed and cleaned the dataset using Pandas to handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure data accuracy.

Data Analysis: Performed detailed numerical analysis with NumPy to extract and summarize key metrics, including confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

Data Visualization: Created a variety of visualizations using Matplotlib, including bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps, to effectively illustrate trends and distributions.

Objectives

Provide a clear visualization of COVID-19 trends and case distributions.

Offer insights into the impact of the pandemic across various regions.

Demonstrate the use of Python for data analysis and visualization tasks.
